Framework Overview
==================

GNNBuilder has several components that work together in a larger, framework-defined workflow. Both the components and the workflow are exposed to the user via the GNNBuilder library. This enables users to create their own workflows or integrate GNNBuilder into their current experiments and design flows for their downstream applications of interest.
